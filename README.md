The content tex files include some examples (not totaly clean) so that you can quickly reused in your cases, like introduce tables, images, algorithms.
I suggest you to use WinEdt to edit and compile the tex files.

Use [www.uinio.com/Math/LaTex](http://www.uinio.com/Math/LaTex/) as handle book to write your Tex document!
