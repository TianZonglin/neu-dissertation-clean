The content tex files include some examples (not totally clean) so that you can quickly be reused them in your cases, like introducing tables, images, and algorithms.
I suggest you to use WinEdt to edit and compile the tex files.

Use [www.uinio.com/Math/LaTex](http://www.uinio.com/Math/LaTex/) as a handlebook to write your Tex document!
